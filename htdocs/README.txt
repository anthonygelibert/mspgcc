The .html files are autogenerated from the .ht files with the ht2html tool.
This tool wraps the design and navigation around the content of the .ht
files.

docs:     http://ht2html.sourceforge.net/
download: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ht2html

This pages design is in the file mspgccGenerator.py it also uses
InlinePython.py, an extension by me.

InlinePython supports two tags: £py-expr£ and <py>py-code</py>
That code is executed at generation time and the result is substitued with
the tags, the resulting pages are static, no server side scriting etc
involved.

Look at the Makefile to get an idea on how to call ht2html. The Makefile
contains some user specific names and paths, sorry for that.
